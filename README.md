# Librarian
App for managing a library.

Todo List:
- [X] Admin - Backend (Laravel, Inertia, Vue)
- [X] API (Laravel & JWT Auth)
- [ ] Loan Book - Frontend (NextJS, Tailwind, Shadcn UI)
- [ ] Loan Book - Mobile (Flutter)

It's just to demonstrated that I can build a fullstack application using Laravel and the others tech stack. This source of code is free to used.
